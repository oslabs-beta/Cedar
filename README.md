### About Cedar 

Serverless architecture is here to stay as it gives programmers the freedom to focus on developing code rather than deal with the added work of maintaining a physical server. 

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda is top dog in the serverless universe as it’s a cost-effective, event-driven computing service that runs code on a high-availability computing infrastructure and automates server and operating system maintenance, load balancing, code monitoring, and logging. 

With AWS’ many services and hefty docs, however, navigating the AWS console can become quite challenging, especially when the goal is to quickly track the overall health of your serverless application.

Cedar was built as a free, open-source Lambda function visualization tool that developers can securely connect their AWS accounts to and use to monitor key metrics and logs data at a glance.
