### About Cedar 

Serverless architecture is here to stay as it gives programmers the freedom to focus on developing code rather than deal with the added work of maintaining a physical server. 

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda is top dog in the serverless universe as it’s a cost-effective, event-driven computing service that runs code on a high-availability computing infrastructure and automates server and operating system maintenance, load balancing, code monitoring, and logging. 

With AWS’ many services and hefty docs, however, navigating the AWS console can become quite challenging, especially when the goal is to quickly track the overall health of your serverless application.

Cedar was built as a free, open-source Lambda function visualization tool that developers can securely connect their AWS accounts to and use to monitor key metrics and logs data at a glance.

### Desmistify your AWS Lambda function metrics and logs w/ Cedar!

You will be redirected to a metrics page where you can choose your functions, metrics and time period. Hit the 'Go' button and your function metrics will be displayed on easy-to-read graphs

If you want to check out your logs, hit the 'Logs' button on the top left of the 'Metrics' page. Pick your function and time period; a chart will be rendered with the 'start', 'end', 'report', and 'error' events for a particular function's logs. If you want to get more specific, you have options with the 'Filter by' and 'Sort by' drop-downs.
